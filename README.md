# mountainhub-api
MountainHub API access, Python package and API documentation

Will start with code currently present in other repos: the [validation repo](https://github.com/communitysnowobs/validation) also contains Python code to read from the MountainHub API: https://github.com/communitysnowobs/validation/blob/master/validation/MountainHub.py. That code has basically the same functionality as the one at `cso-legacy-api`, https://github.com/communitysnowobs/cso-legacy-api/blob/master/src/resources/obs/MountainHub.py. But they're not identical. Ultimately, we should consolidate these two and leave a single, well documented, master code (package?) to access the MountainHub API. Both of these code bases were last updated in mid 2018.

Will also add information and links about the MountainHub data and API proper
